# Frontend for IoT SWENG 500 Project Group 1

Frontend of the project which handles displaying the UI and sending user requests to the server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installing

Steps for installing the Frontend

1. Using a command prompt, navigate to the FrontEnd directory of the project, i.e.,
```
/git/SWENG500/FrontEnd
```
2. Run 
```
npm install
```
3. Run
```
npm run build
```
This will build and start the project.

4. For hot reloading while developing, run
```
npm run start -s
```
this will result in saved changes to disk automatically updating the browser window with these changes.

## Running the tests

All tests will automatically be run with every build. However, to run tests independently of the build process, run
```
npm run test
```

## Deployment

All distribution files will be placed in the /FrontEnd/dist folder after executing 
```
npm run build
```
