# Data Generator for IoT SWENG 500 Project Group 1

Data Generator piece of the project which creates sensors and values as JSON payloads.

## Getting Started

Don't have any instructions yet for getting this on your system, but they would go here.

### Prerequisites

Sample pieces for needed for installation

```
Any examples we need for getting this up?
```

### Installing

Steps for installing the Data Generator

First step is to have all the files on your machine.

```
Play.java 
Sensor.java
SensorService.java
SensorConfig.java
Util.java
```

Place them all together and run Play.java as an application.

Example of data that comes out of system running:
```
{"name":"Ramp Sensor","id":3,"value":5}
{"name":"Random Sensor","id":1,"value":72}
{"name":"Sin Sensor","id":4,"value":0}
{"name":"Binary Sensor","id":2,"value":1}
```

## Running the tests



### Data Generator Tests

The tests in the PayloadGeneratorTest.java file test the system to make sure all the methods and outputs are functioning as expected.

The file need is:

```
PayloadGeneratorTest.java
```

Run as a JUnit Test to see the test results pass to ensure the code is operating as expected.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system?
