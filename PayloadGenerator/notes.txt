To do:

1)  SensorFactory needs to return an error if integer id is already in use.
2)  Still need to think through consistency issues between DB and PayloadGenerator.
3)  How do we want to return errors through the front end?  I can throw exception, 
but are there certain exceptions that we want to handle gracefully with UI?
4)  What happens on CRUD operations to running sensors?
5)  Any properties of a Payload that we want to change (update) after Payload has started need to be
referenced by Payload in parent sensor.  Should this be hanlded through composition?

DataService -> 	SensorService 	-> 	Sensor -> 	Payload -> 	static - ExecutorService???
								->	SensorFactory
			->  DatabaseStuff

6)  More error checking and handling on format of input from front end in DataService?
7)  How to handle database rehydration?
8)  How to handle front end passing id on create?  Should it pass no id, 
and then the backend should return an id?
9)  Somethign weird is happening with enforcing mins and max's in payload generator.

To do:

All database logic from DataService.
Test Cases.
Implement "sensor exists" function.
